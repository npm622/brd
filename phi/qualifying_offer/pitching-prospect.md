The "readiness" of a Minor League pitcher depends on many factors, only a small subset of which comes under the purview of a front office's R&D team.  There is no one-size-fits-all model when it comes to the human anatomy and its development.  However, I would attempt to quantify certain aspects of the player to gain better insight into his capacity for workload, pitch inventory, and mental makeup.

A first concern is how this player will hold up through the grind of a full season*.  First, I would chart the innings pitched for each of the player’s seasons to date**.  A prospect should not drastically increase his workload between seasons.  Additionally, is the pitcher throwing around 100 pitches per game?  If not, it will be tough to go deep into Major League games.

Next, I would want a statistical profile of the prospect’s pitch inventory: what different pitches does he throw with what velocities and spins? This would help show any strongly-matched comparisons*** and how they’ve fared (stuff-wise) against Major League hitters.

Lastly, mental makeup information could come in the way of looking at slices of his pitching statistics in game situations such as shut-down**** or bounce-back***** innings.  This information could help identify potential areas of weakness that could signify whether a player is ready for promotion. 


```cmd
* or whatever remainder of a season is left at the time
** a Major League pitcher should eventually be expected to contribute 200+ innings each season
*** by matching against all Major Leaguers’ pitch inventories (current and past)
**** innings which follow a half-inning in which his team had scored runs
***** innings which follow an inning in which the opponent had scored runs
```
